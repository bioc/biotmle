Description: This package facilitates the discovery of biomarkers from
    biological sequencing data (e.g., microarrays, RNA-seq) based on the
    associations of potential biomarkers with exposure variables by implementing
    an inferential procedure that combines a generalization of moderated
    statistics with targeted minimum loss estimates of the average treatment
    effect whose estimator admits an asymptotically linear representations (in
    terms of an efficient influence function).
