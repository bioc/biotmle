Description: This package facilitates the discovery of biomarkers from
        biological sequencing data (e.g., microarrays, RNA-seq) based
        on the associations of potential biomarkers with exposure and
        outcome variables by implementing an estimation procedure that
        combines a generalization of the moderated t-statistic with
        asymptotically linear statistical parameters estimated via
        targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE).
