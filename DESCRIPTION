Description: This package facilitates the discovery of biomarkers from
    biological sequencing data (e.g., microarrays, RNA-seq) based on the
    associations of potential biomarkers with exposure and outcome variables by
    implementing an estimation procedure that combines a generalization of
    moderated statistics with targeted minimum loss-based estimates (TMLE) of
    causal parameters (e.g., Average Treatment Effect) whose estimators admit
    asymptotically linear representations (in terms of influence functions).
