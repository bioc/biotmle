Description: This package facilitates the discovery of biomarkers from
    biological sequencing data (e.g., microarrays, RNA-seq) based on the
    associations of potential biomarkers with exposure and outcome variables by
    implementing an estimation procedure that combines a generalization of
    moderated statistics with asymptotically linear statistical parameters
    estimated via targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE).
