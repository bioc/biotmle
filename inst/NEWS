biotmle 1.15.0 (BioC 3.14):
- Removal of `future` and `doFuture` for simplification of parallelization. All
  control of parallel computation now done through `BiocParallel`.

---

biotmle 1.13.0 (BioC 3.13):
- No significant updates.

---


biotmle 1.12.0 (BioC 3.12):
- No significant updates.

---

biotmle 1.11.0 (BioC 3.11):
- Change of estimation backend from the `tmle` package to the `drtmle` package.
- Removal of option to have repeated subjects since unsupported in new backend.
- Adds argument `bppar_debug` to facilitate debugging around parallelization.

---

biotmle 1.10.0 (BioC 3.10):
- No significant updates.

---

biotmle 1.8.0 (BioC 3.9):
- No significant updates.

---

biotmle 1.6.0 (BioC 3.8):
- No significant updates.

---

biotmle 1.4.0 (BioC 3.7):
- An updated release of this package for Bioconductor 3.7, released April 2018.
- This release primarily implements minor changes, including the use of colors
  in the plots produced by the visualization methods.

---

biotmle 1.3.0 (BioC 3.6):
- An updated release of this package for Bioconductor 3.6, released in October
  2017.
- An option for applying this methodology to next-generation sequencing data has
  been added, based on the popular "voom" transform of the limma R package.
- Facilities for parallelized computation have been completely re-implemented:
  current routines favor a combination of future and BiocParallel.
- The method for estimating biomarkers based on an observed outcome has been
  removed (temporarily). Inference based on this method requires re-thinking.
- A full suite of unit tests have been added, covering most package functions.

---

biotmle 1.0.0 (BioC 3.5):
- The first release of this package was made as part of Bioconductor 3.5, in
  2016.
