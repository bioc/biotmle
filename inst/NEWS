biotmle 1.4.0 (BioC 3.7):
- An updated release of this package for Bioconductor 3.7, released April 2018.
- This release includes minor changes, including the use of colors in the plots
  produced by the visualization methods.

---

biotmle 1.3.0 (BioC 3.6):
- An option for applying this methodology to next-generation sequencing data has
  been added, based on the popular "voom" transform of the limma R package.
- Facilities for parallelized computation have been completely re-implemented:
  current routines favor a combination of future and BiocParallel.
- The method for estimating biomarkers based on an observed outcome has been
  removed (temporarily). Inference based on this method requires re-thinking.
- A full suite of unit tests have been added, covering most package functions.

---

biotmle 1.0.0 (BioC 3.5):
- The first release of this package was made as part of Bioconductor 3.5, in
  2016.

The biotmle R package provides routines for the statistical methodology first
described in the technical manuscript [1] using the implementation described in
the software paper [2]:
