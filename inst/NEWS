biotmle 1.1.5:
- An option for applying this methodology to next-generation sequencing data has
  been added, based on the popular "voom" transform of the limma R package.
- Facilities for parallelized computation have been completely re-implemented:
  current routines favor a combination of future and BiocParallel.
- The method for estimating biomarkers based on an observed outcome has been
  removed (temporarily). Inference based on this method requires re-thinking.
- A full suite of unit tests have been added, covering most package functions.

biotmle 1.0.0:
- The first release of this package was made as part of Bioconductor 3.5, in
   2016.

The biotmle R package provides routines for the method first described in the
the technical manuscript [1] and the software paper [2]:
