\title{Biomarker Evaluation with Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation (TMLE)}
\usage{
biomarkertmle(se, varInt, ngscounts = FALSE, parallel = TRUE,
  family = "gaussian", subj_ids = NULL, g_lib = c("SL.glm",
  "SL.randomForest", "SL.nnet", "SL.polymars", "SL.mean"), Q_lib = c("SL.glm",
  "SL.randomForest", "SL.nnet", "SL.mean"))
}
\arguments{
\item{se}{(SummarizedExperiment) - containing expression or next-generation
sequencing data in the "assays" slot and a matrix of phenotype-level
data in the "colData" slot.}

\item{varInt}{(numeric) - indicating the column of the design matrix
corresponding to the treatment or outcome of interest (in the
"colData" slot of the "se" argument above).}

\item{ngscounts}{(logical) - whether the data are counts generated from a
next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiment (e.g., RNA-seq). The
default setting assumes continuous expression measures as generated by
microarray-type platforms.}

\item{parallel}{(logical, numeric) - whether to use or the number of cores to
be used when the TMLE-based estimation procedure is parallelized.}

\item{family}{(character) - specification of error family: "binomial" or
"gaussian".}

\item{subj_ids}{(numeric vector) - subject IDs to be passed directly to
the same subject should have the exact same numerical identifier;
coerced to numeric if not provided in the appropriate form.}

\item{g_lib}{(char vector) - library of learning algorithms to be used in
fitting the "g" step of the standard TMLE procedure.}

\item{Q_lib}{(char vector) - library of learning algorithms to be used in
fitting the "Q" step of the standard TMLE procedure.}
}
\value{
S4 object of class \code{biotmle}, generated by sub-classing
        \code{SummarizedExperiment}, with additional slots containing
        \code{tmleOut} and \code{call}, among others, containing TMLE-based
        estimates of the relationship between a biomarker and exposure or
        outcome variable and the original call to this function (for user
        reference), respectively.
}
\description{
Computes the causal target parameter defined as the difference between the
biomarker expression values under treatment and those same values under no
treatment, using Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation.
