## What's `biotmle`?

The `biotmle` R package facilitates biomarker discovery through a generalization
of the moderated t-statistic [@smyth2004linear] that extends the procedure to
locally efficient estimators of asymptotically linear target parameters
[@tsiatis2007semiparametric]. The set of methods implemented modify targeted
maximum likelihood (TML) estimators of statistical (or causal) target parameters
(e.g., average treatment effect) to apply variance moderation to the standard
variance estimator based on the efficient influence function (EIF) of the target
parameter [@vdl2011targeted; @vdl2018targeted]. By performing a moderated
hypothesis test that pools the individual probe-specific EIF-based variance
estimates, a robust variance estimator is constructed, which stabilizes the
standard error estimates and improves the performance of such estimators both in
smaller samples and in settings where the EIF is poorly estimated. The resultant
procedure allows for the construction of conservative hypothesis tests that
reduce the false discovery rate and/or the family-wise error rate
[@hejazi2019+generalization]. Improvements upon prior TML-based approaches to
biomarker discovery (e.g., @bembom2009biomarker) include both the moderated
variance estimator as well as the use of conservative reference distributions
for the corresponding moderated test statistics (e.g., logistic distribution),
inspired by tail bounds based on concentration
inequalities [@rosenblum2009confidence]; the latter prove critical for obtaining
robust inference when the finite-sample distribution of the estimator deviates
from normality.

## Installation

For standard use, install from
[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/biotmle) using
[`BiocManager`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BiocManager):

```{r bioc-installation, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE)) {
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}
BiocManager::install("biotmle")
```

To contribute, install the bleeding-edge _development version_ from GitHub via
[`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("nhejazi/biotmle")
```

Current and prior [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org) releases are
available under branches with numbers prefixed by "RELEASE_". For example, to
install the version of this package available via Bioconductor 3.6, use

```{r gh-develop-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("nhejazi/biotmle", ref = "RELEASE_3_6")
```
